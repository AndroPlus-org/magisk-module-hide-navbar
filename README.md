#### Hide navigation bar

This module will hide navigation bar (for LMT or other gesture app users).
Tested on Android 8.1 Oreo ROM (Google Pixel 2 XL).

#### How does it works?

This module sets "qemu.hw.mainkeys" property to "1", which means "this device has hardware navigation key and we should hide navigation bar".
